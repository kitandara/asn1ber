Fork of  [ASN Bean](https://github.com/beanit/asn1bean), updates the compiler to add generation of [GoLang](https://go.dev/)  classes/structs and methods.
The generated classes can then be used together with the [ASN1BER](https://github.com/kitandara/asn1ber)  Go libraries to efficiently encode and decode messages using the Basic Encoding Rules (BER). 
The encoded bytes also conform to the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) which is a subset of BER. conversion of ASN.1 definitions to code to encode/decode BER objects
